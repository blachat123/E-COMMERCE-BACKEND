Description
------------

This project is a backend system for an e-commerce platform built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a robust API with three main components: user authentication, product management, and order processing. The authentication system uses JWT tokens and bcrypt for secure user registration and login. Product management allows for creating and retrieving product information, while the order processing system handles purchase transactions, stock management, and order history. The system includes security features like password hashing and protected routes, and is designed to be scalable and easily integrated with a frontend application.
